Employers generally consider attrition a loss of valuable employees and talent. It  generally has a negative effect on the company's profits and growth. 
Factors like- employee’s work-life balance, educational qualifications, average monthly income or some aspects of the company, like- unwanted change in company structure or 
management might cause employees to leave the company.
Hence it is important to find out which variables are influencing the attrition of the employees and devise models to predict which employee is likely to churn to help 
the business to devise policies and attract back the right talent.
