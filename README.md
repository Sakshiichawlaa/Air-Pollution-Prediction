Air Pollution Prediction

The increasing levels of pollutants in air due to industrialization and vehicular emissions, has deteriorated the air quality of India at an alarming rate. Its effects are majorly seen in metropolitan cities of India. Thus, there is an immediate need to analyze air pollution trends in order to accurately predict and hence control the air quality for the upcoming years.
This study focuses on the air quality in Delhi-NCR region (Anand Vihar). 
The prediction of future air quality has been carried out by analyzing the air pollutants trends using data analysis techniques
In this project, we propose these data-driven models: 1.Artificial Neural Network, 2. Support Vector Machine and 3. ARIMA, in order to predict and forecast pollution levels due to multiple air quality parameters using historical air quality data, meteorological data and weather forecast data.
The objective is to examine the flexibility of Support Vector Machine (SVM) in time series forecasting by comparing it with a multi-layer back-propagation (BP) neural network.
